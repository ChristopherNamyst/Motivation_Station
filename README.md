Motivation Station was built with React/ React Router/ Redux/ Firebase.

Concepts used in this Application:

1. Authentication: allows users to sign up, and sign into an application with information such as an email, password, and displayName.

2. React Router - a JavaScript library that allows for routing in React applications. With React Router, applications can allow urls to hit specific components.

3. Firebase - a service provided by google that allows for applications to have real-time databases as well as full authentication.

4. Firebase references - map to locations on a firebase database to allow manipulation of data through multiple methods.

5. BrowserHistory - allows React applications to keep track of the user navigation throughout the application by storing visited urls. Also allows the application to handle redirecting the user to specific components.

6. CombineReducers - a redux method which allows applications to combine multiple reducers and export them as a single reducer.


Challenges/ Stretch Goals:

1. Create user teams to assign goals to specific teams.

2. Have a feed of signed in users and assign goals to specific users.

3. Add a forgot password link that routes to another page where the user can use the firebase reset password method to change their authentication information.

4. Delete completed goals individually rather than clearing them all at once.
